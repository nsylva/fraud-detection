The notebooks in this repository are related to my final project in W207 - Introduction to Applied Machine Learning, a course in my Masters program at the University of California, Berkeley. These notebooks are currently in a raw format in order to showcase my analytical process and will be refined as time permits.
  
Data for this project come from the Kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition:
